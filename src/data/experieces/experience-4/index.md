Created and transformed interiors, sets, and locations based off of direction from the Set Decorator, responsible for the safety of everyone on my sets, heavy physical labor knowledge was required daily (Carpentry, Greens, Drapery, Masonry, Plumbing), most jobs did not have clear direction so ingenuity was required to bring client's vision to life.

Most notable productions during this time: NFL Superbowl, Swardoski, Verizon, Hyndai, Dior, Nickelodeon, Lifelock, Oil of Olay.
