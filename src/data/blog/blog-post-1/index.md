_Having recently graduated from Hack Reactor and getting my certificate as a Full Stack Developer, I want to start my own coding journey to improve my skills. I don't feel happy where I am yet, I still see code that I don't understand and there is so much still to learn. I want to improve and I want to do it day by so this blog will help to not only hold me accountable, but also to show my progress and gradual improvement over time._

"Currently, I'm trying to do an hour or so of Leetcode a day, but that doesn't feel like it will cut it. I've also started CodeWars problems too. Those don't feel like they will really do much at the end of the day though. I'm not sure, it might just be inexperience but I feel like actually making something is a much better way to improve your skills. I'm currently working to improve this website, improve an older project and start a brand new one. I'm not sure how all this is going to go and I'm a bit unsure, but that's how it always is at the start of something. The first step to being amazing at something is being really terrible at it."

**Reading, watching, immerse yourself in it. Searching for knowledge in every corner, through every avenue. Never stop reaching.**

"YouTube and books purchased through a HumbleBundle sale are going to be my bread and butter currently. For whatever reason I seem to retain information much easier when I read it and take notes. YouTube is nice when I want to see a visual representation of what the code will do, or if I want to deep dive on a specific topic in a specific language but it doesn't really cut it for me with learning and studying. Hopefully that will change, 365 days from now I want to look back on this post and have achieved what I'm striving for. That's why the Lao Tzu quote speaks to me, because this journey is just starting."
