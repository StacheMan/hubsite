_Sadly on the road to life there are many setbacks. When you fall down, you have to make sure to get back up. It doesn't matter how many times you get knocked down, you just have to dust yourself off and get back up._

**If opportunity doesn't knock, build a door. - Milton Berle**

Some days, it feels like I don't know anything about programming. The hardest part about starting something new like this, is fighting yourself. Imposter Syndrome is going to be a daily struggle and it is only increased by failures and a lack of understanding.

The only way is to keep pushing forward. Keep trying, keep coding, keep failing and from the failures you'll learn. I've learnt more from my bugs than from my successes and I'll continue to do so, but it will an arduous path. Eventually I'll be on the other side of this and able to program but for now, I'm still unsure and learning.
