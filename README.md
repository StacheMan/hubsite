# Welcome to my Website!

This is my personal Website that I created using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/), [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/), [Talwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) & [React Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/react-fontawesome).

## Porfolio Piece

This website was created as a way to showcase my skills in Front End Software Engineering and also to be a hub for my Portfolio. As I have my hand in more projects, I'll be creating a page for you to access them directly.

**Please feel free to view it yourself!**
